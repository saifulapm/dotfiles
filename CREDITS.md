Code and patterns borrowed from MIT-licensed projects, recorded exactly.
Reference checkouts live in `~/ref/` (read-only, never symlinked into live config).

## omarchy (MIT) — github.com/basecamp/omarchy

- **Architecture patterns** from `shell/shell.qml`: services instantiated once at the
  root and passed by property injection (relative-path imports do not share singleton
  state); hardcoded fallback config so the shell renders a bar even with a broken
  user config; one Loader per summonable panel keyed by an open-set, with pending
  payload queues; IPC summon/hide/toggle surface.
- **Foot live retheme** approach from `bin/omarchy-theme-set-foot` +
  `bin/omarchy-theme-osc`: write OSC color escape sequences directly to each foot
  child's pty so open terminals retheme without restart.
- **Structural token concept** from `shell/Commons/Style.qml`: spacing scale as the
  shell's rem, font size ratios, state-token alpha recipes.
- **Clock/calendar plugin design** from `shell/plugins/panels/clock/`: hero date
  over a year-progress rail, memento-mori life bar with inline birth-year editor,
  ISO week-number gutter, locale-honoring week start with click-to-toggle
  persisted to shell.json; plus the inline widget-settings pattern
  (layout entries as `{id, ...settings}` objects, `updateEntryInline` writing
  them back atomically, format-ring cycling on the bar clock).
- **Theme palettes** from `themes/*/colors.toml`: all files in `themes/` except
  `tokyo-night.toml` are generated ports of omarchy's theme colors via
  `bin/theme-port-omarchy` (surface/text/accent/ansi mapping documented there).
  Non-color tokens (shape/motion) in those files are ours. Muted/primary text
  colors may differ from the source where our contrast floor adjusted them.

## DankMaterialShell (MIT) — github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell

- **niri event-stream pattern** from `quickshell/Services/NiriService.qml`:
  `Socket` on `$NIRI_SOCKET`, send `"EventStream"`, parse newline-delimited JSON
  with `SplitParser`, dispatch on the event's single key.
- **LazyLoader + IPC popout pattern** from `DMSShell.qml` / `Services/PopoutService.qml`:
  every popout behind `active: false` loaders flipped by IPC handlers.

## noctalia (MIT) — github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell

- **Contrast-by-construction algorithm** from `src/theme/contrast.cpp`:
  `ensureContrast()` — WCAG-ratio target searched via 20-step binary search on
  OKLCH lightness with chroma-only gamut mapping. Ported to
  `shell/Commons/color.js`, consumed by `Services/Theme.qml` (derived
  on-accent + validation) and `bin/theme-apply` (template fan-out).
- **Surface-ladder derivation idea** from `src/theme/custom_schemes.cpp`:
  elevations as recipes (keep hue, cap saturation, force lightness).

## quickshell (LGPL/source reference) — github.com/quickshell-mirror/quickshell

- Used as API reference only; no code copied.

---
Direct file-level copies (source path → destination path):

- omarchy `shell/plugins/panels/clock/Model.js` → `shell/Modules/Bar/widgets/ClockModel.js`:
  near-verbatim port of the date/format math (format ring, ISO week, year/life
  progress parsing and percentages, six-row month grid). Vertical-bar formats and
  the node test exports were dropped; whitespace restyled to house 4-space qmlformat.
